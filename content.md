## Hero

_Through younger generations, we are given the opportunity to feel young again. So completely free. It makes the idea of innate evil and horror seem out worldly. What does it take to challenge the belief that even children can be rotten from the core, with envy and hatred spilling out of their guts?_

## Concept

_Tapping into the primal fears and existential dread that lurk within the human psyche is what the epitome of psychological horror can be defined as. It thrives on the subtle, the unseen, and the uncanny, transforming ordinary situations into profound explorations of human nature and the darkness that resides within us all._

_At the heart of this modern renaissance lies the unmistakable influence of Michael Haneke, a filmmaker whose work has profoundly shaped the sensibilities of contemporary horror and drama screenwriters. Haneke's films, such as "Funny Games" and "Cache," are masterclasses in discomfort and unease. His meticulous control over pacing, his use of prolonged shots, and his ability to draw horror from the mundane have left an indelible mark on the genre. Haneke doesn't just show us horror; he makes us feel it, implicating us in the narrative and forcing us to confront our own complicity and voyeurism._

_This approach resonates deeply with a new generation of filmmakers who seek to elevate horror beyond its conventional boundaries. They draw from Haneke's playbook, utilizing his techniques to create films that linger long after the credits roll. Films that understand that true horror is not about what is seen, but what is felt—the slow, creeping dread that something is fundamentally wrong._

_In discussing these connections, one cannot help but feel a sense of reverence and excitement. It's like being part of a clandestine conversation among cinephiles, where the shared understanding of these influences deepens the appreciation of the films themselves. Michael Haneke's work is a touchstone, a beacon for those who seek to explore the darker recesses of the human experience through the lens of horror. His influence is a testament to the power of cinema to not only entertain but to challenge, provoke, and ultimately transform._

_As we continue to delve into this golden age of elevated horror, the fingerprints of Haneke's mastery are evident, guiding us through narratives that are as haunting as they are profound. And for those of us who cherish the art of filmmaking, this is a conversation that never grows old, a perpetual exploration of the shadows that define the human soul._

## Director

_“I try to make anti-psychological films with characters who are less characters than projection surfaces for the sensibilities of the viewer; blank spaces force the spectator to bring his own thoughts and feelings to the film. Because that is what makes the viewer open for the sensitivity of the character. Every film is manipulative, raping the viewer. So the question is: Why do I rape the viewer?”_
