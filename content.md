## hero

_Through younger generations, we are given the opportunity to feel young again. So completely free. It makes the idea of innate evil and horror seem out worldly. What does it take to challenge the belief that even children can be rotten from the core, with envy and hatred spilling out of their guts?_

## Concept

_Tapping into the primal fears and existential dread that lurk within the human psyche is what the epitome of psychological horror can be defined as. It thrives on the subtle, the unseen, and the uncanny, transforming ordinary situations into profound explorations of human nature and the darkness that resides within us all. Films like "Hereditary," "The Babadook," and "It Follows" encapsulate this essence, where the horror is not just external but deeply internal, drawing from the characters' psychological landscapes and, in turn, our own._

_At the heart of this modern renaissance lies the unmistakable influence of **Michael Haneke**, a filmmaker whose work has profoundly shaped the sensibilities of contemporary horror and drama screenwriters. Haneke's films, such as "Funny Games" and "Cache," are masterclasses in discomfort and unease. His meticulous control over pacing, his use of prolonged shots, and his ability to draw horror from the mundane have left an indelible mark on the genre. Haneke doesn't just show us horror; he makes us feel it, implicating us in the narrative and forcing us to confront our own complicity and voyeurism._

_This approach resonates deeply with a new generation of filmmakers who seek to elevate horror beyond its conventional boundaries. They draw from Haneke's playbook, utilizing his techniques to create films that linger long after the credits roll. These filmmakers understand that true horror is not about what is seen, but what is felt—the slow, creeping dread that something is fundamentally wrong. They use silence, stillness, and the ordinary to extraordinary effect, crafting stories that are as much about the human condition as they are about the supernatural or the horrific._

_In discussing these connections, one cannot help but feel a sense of reverence and excitement. It's like being part of a clandestine conversation among cinephiles, where the shared understanding of these influences deepens the appreciation of the films themselves. Michael Haneke's work is a touchstone, a beacon for those who seek to explore the darker recesses of the human experience through the lens of horror. His influence is a testament to the power of cinema to not only entertain but to challenge, provoke, and ultimately transform._

_As we continue to delve into this golden age of elevated horror, the fingerprints of Haneke's mastery are evident, guiding us through narratives that are as haunting as they are profound. And for those of us who cherish the art of filmmaking, this is a conversation that never grows old, a perpetual exploration of the shadows that define the human soul._

## Director

_Most people don’t know that before becoming a filmmaker, Haneke studied psychology, philosophy, and drama in college, which totally shows in the psychological depth of his films. He also worked in theater and TV for years before making his first feature film at nearly 47. This late start in film probably gave him a lot of life experience and a unique perspective that’s evident in his work._
